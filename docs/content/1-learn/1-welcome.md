# Welcome

Welcome to the Omni documentation! Omni is a technology designed to make the Ethereum ecosystem feel like a single chain for users and developers.

This documentation is your guide to understanding, building with, and operating Omni. Whether you’re here to explore the Omni Orderflow Engine, integrate Omni Core or SolverNet into your application, or run a validator, you’ll find the resources you need to get started.

## What is Omni?

At its core, Omni abstracts away the complexities of cross-chain interactions, enabling:

- **Developers** to deploy applications on a single rollup while reaching users and liquidity across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
- **Users** to interact with applications on any rollup without bridging, managing gas, or switching networks.

Omni is built around two primary components:

- **Omni Core**: A protocol for decentralized cross-rollup messaging and computation.
- **SolverNet**: A network enabling intent-based execution across chains.

Together, they form the **Omni Orderflow Engine**, infrastructure for coordinating and settling all cross-chain actions.

## Getting Started

Explore the **Learn** section to dive into Omni’s purpose, architecture, and key components:

- [Why Omni?](/1-learn/2-why) Understand the challenges Omni solves.
- [What is the Omni Orderflow Engine?](/1-learn/2-what) Learn how Omni Core and SolverNet work together.
- [Omni Core and SolverNet](/1-learn/3-core) Discover the details of Omni’s two primary components.

From there, move into the [Build with Core](/2-core/start), [Build with SolverNet](/3-solvernet/intro), or [Operate](/4-operate) sections for practical guidance.

We’re excited to have you here as we redefine what’s possible in Ethereum’s rollup-centric future.
