# Why Omni?

## The Problem

The most glaring side effect of Ethereum’s pursuit of the rollup-centric roadmap is fragmentation of users and capital across the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This has degraded both the developer and user experiences on Ethereum.

**For developers**
- applications are siloed on individual rollups, limiting their ability to reach users across the ecosystem
- deploying on multiple rollups is complex, developers can either deploy copies of their application to multiple rollups, which means each deployment is isolated from the others, must be maintained independently. Or, they can rearchitect their applications to communicate across chains – which turns building smart contracts into building a distributed system. The whole point of solidity is to abstract a complex distributed system into a single threaded virtual machine for developers to reason about. Building multichain contracts reverts to distributed systems design!

**For users**
- it's painful
- they must navigate application frontends, select networks, switch RPC endpoints, and manually bridge assets between networks, all while ensuring they have enough gas to complete transactions on the destination network.

## The Solution

Omni simplifies and unifies the Ethereum ecosystem by abstracting away cross-chain complexity.

**For Developers:**

- Deploy applications on a single rollup and instantly reach users and liquidity across the Ethereum ecosystem.
- No need to redesign or re-audit contracts for cross-chain functionality.
- No need to maintain multiple deployments of your application.
- No need to manage cross-chain logic in your contracts.
- No need to worry about cross chain security.

**For Users:**

- Seamless access to decentralized applications without bridging, network switching, or managing gas fees across chains.
- Omni makes the Ethereum ecosystem feel like a single, unified chain.

Omni ensures that the Ethereum ecosystem can scale without sacrificing usability or developer efficiency
