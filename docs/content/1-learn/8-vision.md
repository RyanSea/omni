# The Vision

Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap has unlocked scalability but fragmented users and liquidity across rollups. This fragmentation creates friction for both developers and users. Omni’s mission is to solve this problem by unifying the ecosystem.

## Solving Fragmentation

Omni eliminates the complexity of interacting with multiple rollups. Developers can build on a single rollup while seamlessly accessing the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Users can interact with these applications without ever dealing with bridging, network switching, or gas management. Omni transforms fragmentation into a unified, scalable system.

## An Open Orderflow Execution Engine

Traditional finance relies on exclusive systems like Robinhood’s Payment for Order Flow (PFoF) deals with market makers like Citadel. These opaque agreements centralize power and concentrate benefits among a select few.

Omni is building the open alternative: a permissionless orderflow execution engine. Anyone can participate in routing and executing cross-chain intents, ensuring users always get the best execution with full transparency. This infrastructure empowers developers, solvers, and users to build on equitable and open rails, setting the foundation for an equitable global financial system.
